{"name":"Explore Flask","tagline":"","body":"# Explore Flask\r\n\r\nHello and welcome to the source material of *Explore Flask*! The book is available for sale in PDF form at http://exploreflask.com.\r\n\r\nThe book is currently in development. I've decided to release things in this unfinished state and finish the development of *Explore Flask* out in the open. I'm hoping that early feedback from the community will help make this an amazing book by version 1.0.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nThe book is built using pandoc and Make. Once you have those set-up on your system you can just run `make` in the _explore-flask/_ repository. That should produce a _build.pdf_ build of the book.\r\n\r\nThe master branch is the source of the latest release. Each release is also tagged with the version number. The progress branch is where you'll find the changes meant for future releases.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe book is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/).  You are free to share and remix the book, as long as you provide attribution and do not attempt to re-sell.\r\n\r\nI absolutely welcome bug reports and pull requests. If you want me to merge your changes from a pull request, it implies that you're granting me a full, transferable license to modify, distribute, sell, and otherwise use those changes in any capacity. You'll retain the copyright, but I can do whatever I need/want to with the work and I can grant others the same license.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nThe whole point of putting the unfinished book out is to get feedback from readers like you. You can submit feedback by opening an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rpicard/explore-flask/issues) or by emailing me at mail+efgithub@robert.io.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* 0.01 - This is the first release. It contains the first 7 chapters in a rough state. Other chapters are in a rougher state so they aren't included.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
