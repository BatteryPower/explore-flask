<p>Hello and welcome to the source material of <em>Explore Flask</em>! The book is available for sale in PDF form at <a href="http://exploreflask.com">http://exploreflask.com</a>.</p>

<p>The book is currently in development. I've decided to release things in this unfinished state and finish the development of <em>Explore Flask</em> out in the open. I'm hoping that early feedback from the community will help make this an amazing book by version 1.0.</p>

<h2>
<a name="building" class="anchor" href="#building"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building</h2>

<p>The book is built using pandoc and Make. Once you have those set-up on your system you can just run <code>make</code> in the <em>explore-flask/</em> repository. That should produce a <em>build.pdf</em> build of the book.</p>

<p>The master branch is the source of the latest release. Each release is also tagged with the version number. The progress branch is where you'll find the changes meant for future releases.</p>
