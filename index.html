        <h2>Get the book</h2>
        <p>The book is currently in development, but I've decided to make it available for purchase to get continuous feedback as I work on future releases.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The current version is 0.01.</li>
          <li>This version contains the first 7 chapters in a rough state.</li>
          <li>Other chapters are excluded as they're still in an even rougher state.</li>
          <li>The formatting of the PDF is also in a rough state. Don't expect anything too pretty just yet.</li>
          <li>If none of this scares you, click the purchase button below</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I want to make the book available to as many people as possible, so you can pay what you feel is appropriate. Everybody who buys the book now (even for $0) will get future versions sent to their email at no cost.</p>
