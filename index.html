          <h2>Get the book</h2>
          <p>The book is currently in development, but I've decided to make it available for purchase to get continuous feedback as I work on future releases.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The current version is 0.01.</li>
            <li>This version contains the first 7 chapters in a rough state.</li>
            <li>Other chapters are excluded as they're still in an even rougher state.</li>
            <li>The formatting of the PDF is also in a rough state. Don't expect anything too pretty just yet.</li>
            <li>If none of this scares you, click the purchase button below!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I want to make the book available to as many people as possible, so you can pay what you feel is appropriate. Everybody who buys the book now (even for $0) will get future versions sent to their email at no cost.</p>

          <p>Robert Picard is a web developer and Flask enthusiast. In May of 2013 he noticed that there wasn't a good book outlining Flask best practices and decided to write it himself. In June, he launched a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1223051718/practical-flask-book-project" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> that would ultimately raise $8,175 from 426 backers all around the world.</p>
