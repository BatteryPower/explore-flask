# Deployment

You're finally ready to show your app to the world. It's time to deploy. This process can be a pain because there are so many moving parts. There are a lot of choices to make when it comes to your production stack as well. I'm going to try and point out the important pieces and some of the options you have with each.

## The Host

You're going to need a server somewhere. There are thousands of providers out there, but these are the three that I personally recommend. 

### Heroku

### Digital Ocean

### AWS

## The stack

### Front server

### Application runner

### Database

## Tools and Services

### Fabric
