# Serving a REST API

## Primer on REST

REST is a pattern for making for making server-side resources available to client applications. The REST application pattern uses HTTP methods to perform operations on those resources. In this section we'll go over resources and methods.

### Resources

Resources are the things that users will be accessing. It's important to distinguish between a resource and a representation of that resource. The resource is the abstract concept of an object used by the application, e.g. a "user." When we're building an API, we will usually serve JSON representations of users (and other resources).

### Methods

HTTP methods, such as the familiar `GET` and `POST` methods are used to view and modify resources. We can perform an operation on a resource by calling a URL, such as `/api/user` with a method that signals our intentions. This is an outline of the basic methods we'll talk about in this section:

{MAKE A TABLE}

url             HTTP Method  Operation
/api/v1.0/users      GET          Get an array of all users
/api/v1.0/users/:id  GET          Get the user with id of :id
/api/v1.0/users      POST         Add a new user and return the user with an id attribute added
/api/v1.0/users/:id  PUT          Update the user with id of :id
/api/v1.0/users/:id  DELETE       Delete the user with id of :id

There are other HTTP methods often used in RESTful APIs, but these are the key players. We can use this structure to back front-end frameworks like Backbone and Angular, or to make resources available to third-party developers.

{ NOTE: You may have noticed the "v1.0" in those URLs. I'm including a version number in the URLs to account for backwards compatibility. If you decide to make API changes after developers have been working with the old API, you can just increment the version number for the new one and tell developers to update their applications to use the new API. There are a lot of different ways to handle versioning, but this is my preference. }

{ NOTE: I'm not going to get too concerned with keeping things "purely RESTful." Sometimes people get worked up about APIs not keeping with the REST philosophy. I'm not one of those people. }

## Flask-RESTful

Flask-RESTful is a Flask extension developed at Twilio that makes defining REST APIs simple. It uses a feature of Flask called `MethodViews`. When a request is routed to a `MethodView` class, the HTTP method of that request is used to determine which class method will handle the request. The `MethodView` class could have a `get()` method as well as a `post()` method, for example. Flask-RESTful wraps `MethodView` and gives us tools to use it for building REST APIs.

### The View Structure

Let's create a simple RESTful API that makes a `User` resource available.

```
from flask import Flask
from flask.ext import restful

app = Flask(__name__)
api = restful.Api(app)

class UserListAPI(restful.Resource):
	def get(self):
    	# Get the list of users
        return users, 200

	def post(self):
    	# Add a user, return status code "201 Created"
        return new_user, 201

class UserAPI(restful.Resource):
	def get(self, id):
    	# Get the user
        return user, 200
    
    def put(self, id):
    	# Update the user
        return updated_user, 200

	def delete(self, id):
    	# Delete the user, return status code "204 No Content"
        return '', 204

api.add_resource(UserListAPI, '/api/v1.0/users', endpoint='users')
api.add_resource(UserAPI, '/api/v1.0/users/<int:id>', endpoint='user')
```

I'll leave the implementation of each function as an exercise for the user, as it's a little out of the scope of this chapter. As you can see, it's trivial to define the methods that can be used to access your resources and how each type of request should be handled. We are also going to need to allow users to log in.

### Authentication

We can keep things simple and use our old friend Flask-Login. Let's take a closer look at the `UserAPI` class.

```
class UserAPI(restful.Resource):
	def get(self, id):
    	# Get the user
        return user, 200
    
    def put(self, id):
    	# Update the user
        return updated_user, 200

	def delete(self, id):
    	# Delete the user, return status code "204 No Content"
        return '', 204
```
